## Vending Machine Application
### A Lindsey and Abi Collab

<p> This vending machine does it all*!</p>
- Takes a .txt file of inventory and reads it
- Displays the inventory items
- Allows the user to purchase those items
- Only allows the user to put in whole dollars (yells at user if they try otherwise)
- Only allows user to put in valid inputs (this part almost made me cry)
- Pulls a Big Brother and writes all interactions into a .txt file called... wait for it... Log.txt
- Even does a solid and returns change to the user (although I argued we should keep the users money as a tip for such a finely coded project)
- Let's the user exit the program (although... why would they want to? It's a beautiful program)

<p> Hopefully someone out there finds this program and enjoys it! It's a sassy vending machine that doesn't mince words, but she works hard and wants someone to love her.</p>

<p>* Okay, maybe not ALL but the list of things it does do is pretty impressive</p>
